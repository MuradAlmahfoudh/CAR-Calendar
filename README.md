# Code-And-Render Calendar


## About Code-And-Render Calendar
Code And Render Calendar is an approach to generate a year calendar in Microsoft Word in 2 steps; coding and rendering. Coding refers to the set of commands user types in a text document that specify the attributes of the calendar to be generated. Rendering refers to dynamically drawing or designing the year calendar according to the commands typed; by executing a Microsoft Word Macro-Enabled document that has a VBA script or program that reads and processes the commands typed from the text document and renders the year calendar accordingly.

## Code-And-Render Calendar Anatomy
Code-And-Render Calendar consists of two files:
- Calendar Executable File (CEF) (Microsoft Word Macro-Enable Document - .docm)
- Calendar Customization Script (CCS) (Text Document - .txt)

### Notes
- When CCS is removed, CEF can still function, however, it would run with the default settings (e.g. current year, default start day and weekend, default title and subtitle … etc)
- Names of CEF and CCS files cannot be changed

## Compatibility
Code-And-Render Calendar should be able to run on any Microsoft Windows machine with Microsoft Word 2010 or higher installed. It may however run with previous versions of Microsoft Word (2007 and 2003).
